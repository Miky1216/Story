Going to Florida every 
year became a lasting 
tradition for me growing 
up. The main 
reason was because my 
mother, who was 
born in Brooklyn, 
spent her high school 
and college years in 
Orlando and Tallahassee. 
During those years, 
she made long-
lasting friends. In 
fact, her two 
college roommates, who 
she has known since 
she was 18 years 
old, remain her 
closest friends to this 
day. Unfortunately, 
they remained in Florida 
while my mother took 
a job in Milwaukee
, which meant traveling 
once a year was 
the only way they 
could physically stay in 
touch. My siblings 
and I have become 
close friends with the 
children of my mother
's roommates. 
Naturally, this has 
led to several great 
moments over the past 
27 years. One 
such moment involved my 
mother, her roommate 
Pam, Pam'
s son Walker and 
I walking Ponda Vedra 
Beach late at night
. Only us, 
the sound of the 
waves in the ocean
, the glowing moon 
and the beautiful night 
sky that was loaded 
with stars. A 
beach that was crowded 
during the day was 
as peaceful and quiet 
as could be. 
The conversations were hilarious
. The walk from 
Ponda Vedra to Jax 
Beach appeared timeless,
even though we had
to deal with occasional
crabs walking past us
in the night.
More importantly, being 
together clearly made us 
all happy. That 
night has led to 
a tradition of us 
walking on the beach 
under the clear night 
sky, a tradition 
that remains to this 
day.
